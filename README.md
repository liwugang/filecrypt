# filecrypt
## Summary

filecrypt - A simple tool to encrypt/decrypt files with user supplied password. Without the right password the files can't be decrypted.
## Usage
```c
usage: ./filecrypt [-e|-d] [-r] [-p password] [-a algorithm] [-h] [-t num_threads] [-D] path
  -e        encrypt the files in the path
  -d        decrypt the files in the path
  -r        recursive the path
  -p        password to encrypt or decrypt
  -a        select algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the files which encrypted by it
            supported algorithms: [xor, aes], xor is default
  -t        thread num to work, range: [1 - cpu_numbers], default: 1
  -D        open debug mode
  -h        show this usage
```
## File encrypt/decrypt algorithms
1. XOR
2. AES
3. ...

## Compile
Execute "make" in the root directory.
